Keyboard Layout Evolver (Original)
==================================

My attempts to find an optimal keyboard layout for a coding-heavy workload.

The main points of interest are the cost function for a given layout, that estimates typing strain, and some sort of genetic-algorithm optimizer.

The code isn't very usable - this may be fixed at a later point or in a newer repository.
